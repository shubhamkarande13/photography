            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Shubham Karande. I am based in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. I hail from the city of Mumbai, India.
            </p>
            <p>As an amateur photographer, I have a passion for capturing beautiful moments through the lens of my
                camera. I am constantly learning and experimenting with new techniques to improve my skills and create
                stunning images that tell a story. Photography is not just a hobby for me, it's a way to express myself
                creatively and share my unique perspective with others. Whether I'm photographing landscapes, people, or
                abstract subjects, I always strive to capture the essence of my subject and convey its beauty to my
                audience. Through my photography, I aim to inspire others, evoke emotions, and leave a lasting impact on
                those who view my work.
